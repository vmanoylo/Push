Players take turns moving, player 1 starts
once a player cannot move any pieces, they lose

players start with
  -4 soldiers that can be pushed forward, backward, left or right
  -5 scouts that can be pushed in any diagonal
  -2 general that can be pushed in all 8 directions

there are also 3 machines, which do not have a team 
and can only be pushed by other pieces
  -Tower, which will push every piece in front of a direction it moves
  -Wall, which will push every piece in a line it is pushed to
         the line is perpendicular to the direction it was pushed
  -Ram, which will move in the direction it is pushed until
        it hits something or leaves the board
        if it hits a piece, it will push with strength equal to 
        how far it was pushed

a machine can be placed anywhere on the board by a player, 
  if that player doesn't already have a machine on the board
  and can give away a piece his opponent has lost

to move a piece
  click on a piece: if that piece can be pushed, arrows will show up 
                    in the top right corner of the screen
  click on an arrow pointing in the direction you want to move the piece

##### PUSHING PIECES #####
moving a piece is equivalent 
to pushing that piece with a piece from the same team and strength 1

piece A is pushed into piece B with X strength
  if A is on the same team as B, B moves one space and 
      pu3hes the next piece with X+1 strength
  if A is not on the same team as B, B becomes teamless for the rest
      of the turn, and moves X spaces, pushing with 1 strength each time
